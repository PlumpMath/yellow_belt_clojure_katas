# Yellow Belt Clojure Katas

This is template for beginner level Clojure Katas done with tests
in [midje](https://github.com/marick/Midje).
The katas are taken more or less from the 
[Coding Kata site](http://codingkata.org/katas/).


## Setup instructions

* Download and install [leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen).
* Clone project.
* CD in the project and run "lein deps".  
* run "lein test".  You should see all the tests run with "WORK TO DO"
* Choose a kata.  The shell source code with instructions is in the src/clojure_katas directory and the test
  is in the test/clojure_katas directory.
* In the test find the change the word 
          future-facts
to  
         facts
or    
         future-fact
to  
         fact
* Run lein test again.  You should have failing tests now
* Fix the the code and run the tests!

If you have any problem setting up the project, please let me know.


## Git Branches

I do have a solution branch with my solutions in them - branch named solutions.  There are also
quite a number of solutions on the Coding Kata site.  I found it fun
to browse them and see how other people solved them after I had
finished mine. 

# Corrections

Being a beginner myself, there might be mistakes or something I
missed.  As always, feedback is welcome.
